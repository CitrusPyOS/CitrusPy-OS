# CitrusPy OS

# What is CitrusPy?
CitrusPy OS is a small and very basic operating system purely simulated using Python. This project is still in it's early stages of development.

# How do I use this product?

## First setup

When you first start this program, you will be asked to enter your region and a Username for your new account. Comply with the instructions and restart.
Your default password is 'default'
Enter your account information and log in. You should see a command prompt.
Enter 'change_pass'. You will be prompted to set a password. After changing your password, please restart and the setup is done.

# What to run on?

For now on, this OS is just a simulation and doesn't have a bootloader yet. Feel free to make your own or run it using a standard Python environment.
